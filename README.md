## Features

- Procedural planet generation: Create unique and realistic planets using procedural algorithms.
- Terrain generation: Generate detailed and customizable terrains with different types of landscapes such as mountains, valleys, and plains.
- Texture mapping: Apply textures to the terrain to enhance visual realism and add visual variety.
- Atmospheric effects: Simulate atmospheric effects such as clouds, haze, and lighting to create a more immersive environment.
- User interaction: Allow users to interact with the generated planet by zooming, rotating, and exploring different regions.

## Installation

You can install PlanetTechJS via npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm install planet-tech-js
\`\`\`

Alternatively, you can include the library directly in your HTML file:

\`\`\`html
<script src="path/to/planet-tech-js.min.js"></script>
\`\`\`

## Getting Started

To generate a procedural planet using PlanetTechJS, follow these steps:

1. Create a container element in your HTML file where the planet will be displayed:

\`\`\`html
<div id="planet-container"></div>
\`\`\`

2. Initialize the PlanetTechJS library and generate a planet:

\`\`\`javascript
// Assuming you have imported the library or included the script

// Get the container element
const container = document.getElementById('planet-container');

// Initialize the planet generator
const generator = new PlanetTechJS.PlanetGenerator();

// Generate a planet inside the container
generator.generatePlanet(container);
\`\`\`

3. Customize the generated planet by adjusting various parameters:

\`\`\`javascript
// Change the planet size
generator.setSize(400); // In pixels

// Adjust the terrain height
generator.setTerrainHeight(0.7); // Value between 0 and 1

// Apply a custom texture
const textureUrl = 'path/to/texture.jpg';
generator.setTexture(textureUrl);

// Enable atmospheric effects
generator.enableAtmosphere();

// Generate the updated planet
generator.generatePlanet(container);
\`\`\`
